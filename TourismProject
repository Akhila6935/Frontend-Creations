This HTML code is a tourism-themed webpage built with Bootstrap and custom CSS. It showcases some popular travel destinations in India, like the Taj Mahal, Golden Temple, Mysore Palace, and Varanasi Temple, with a "Detailed View" section for each place. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of each part:

External Dependencies:
Bootstrap for responsive design and jQuery, Popper.js for JavaScript functionality.
Google Fonts for various font styles.

CSS Styling:
Custom CSS classes (bg-container, tourism-card, etc.) define the visual layout, font styles, and background images for different sections.
Several custom classes define styles for buttons, text, card containers, and background images for a cohesive aesthetic.

Main Sections:
Home Section (sectionHome): A welcoming section with a "Tourism" title, a prompt to "Plan your trip," and a "Get Started" button that shows the next section.

Favorite Places Section (sectionFavouritePlaces): Lists four popular travel spots in a card-based format. Each card has a name, short description, and an image.

Detailed View Sections: Each destination has its own section (sectionTajMahalDetailedView, sectionGoledenTempleDetailedView, etc.) that shows more images and a detailed description of the location.
Each detailed section contains a Bootstrap carousel to display multiple images.
A back button navigates back to the "Favorite Places" section.

JavaScript Functionality:
display() (likely part of an external JS file) toggles between sections based on user interaction, simulating a single-page application (SPA) experience without reloading.
Overall, this code provides a basic tourism website layout, with interactive navigation, smooth transitions between sections, and visual emphasis on each destination's highlights through carousels and background images.
